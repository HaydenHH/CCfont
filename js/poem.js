			Jade dew withers and wounds the groves of maple trees,\
			On Wu mountain, in Wu gorge, the air is dull and drear.\
			On the river surging waves rise to meet the sky,\
			Above the pass wind and cloud join the earth with darkness.\
			Chrysanthemum bushes open twice, weeping for their days,\
			A lonely boat, a single line, my heart is full of home.\
			Winter clothes everywhere are urgently cut and measured,\
			Baidicheng above, the evening's driven by beating on stones.\

					South of my hut, north of my hut, all is spring water,\
					A flock of gulls is all I see come each day.\
					The floral path has never been swept for a guest,\
					Today for the first time the rough gate opens for the gentleman.\
					Far from the market, my food has little taste,\
					My poor home can offer only stale and cloudy wine.\
					Consent to have a drink with my elderly neighbour,\
					At the fence I'll call him, then we'll finish it off."

					Swift wind, heaven high, an ape's cry of grief,\
					At the islet of clear white sand, birds circle round.\
					Endlessly, trees shed leaves, rustling, rustling down,\
					Without cease, the great river surges, surges on.\
					Ten thousand miles in sorrowful autumn, always someone's guest,\
					A hundred years full of sickness, I climb the terrace alone.\
					Suffering troubles, I bitterly regret my whitening temples,\
					Frustratingly I've had to abandon my cup of cloudy wine.\
